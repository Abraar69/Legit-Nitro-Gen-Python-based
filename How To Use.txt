Double Click start .py to run it. If it is not opening make sure that you have python installed
Link -> https://python.org

Once Installed then open start.py and type amount of codes to be generated and checked. 

I made an .EXE version if you don't want to install python

NOTE: Do not enter too many codes because it may lead to system crash
